# Advent of Code Solutions

These are my advent of code solutions. There are many like them, but these are mine.

If you're a potentional employer, this isn't how my code usually looks. I swear!

## How to run

Setup [`advent-of-code-date`](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) 
to get your input, then run one of the scripts with a recent version of python. Some of
them require dependencies. You can install all of those with:

```console
pip install -e path/to/this/repo
```
